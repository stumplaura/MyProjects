## Project #2: Exploration of Python Libraries

Pendulum is used to as a timestamp to print the specific time zones of different places in the world. Pillow is used to manipulate a photo of roses using different functions to do so. 

## Project #3: Language Translation

* Description: In this project, Tkinter was used to translate between languages. It is a way to input a starting language and finally output a language of your choosing. With the help of Tkinter, a grid is made to create the needed boxes, text, and buttons for the code to work, or in other words widgets.
